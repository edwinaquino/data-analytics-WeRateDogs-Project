# Project #4 - WeRateDogs Project 
### Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

In this project, we will be gathering data from the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. The goal for this project is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.

Real-world data rarely comes clean. We will be using Python and its libraries to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. Then, we will assess its quality and tidiness. After that, we will clean the data. This is called data wrangling! On this project we will document our wrangling efforts in this Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and its various libraries.

The dataset that we will be wrangling, analyzing and visualizing is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for us to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.
